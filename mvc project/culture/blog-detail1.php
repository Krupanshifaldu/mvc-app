							<p>What is fabric paint made of? Fabric paint has always been so interesting to me – but is it actually paint? Is it really ink? And what is it made of? I recently acquired some lovely wingback chairs that a neighbor was getting rid of, so I thought it would be best to find out what fabric paint is made of, and if it differs from brand to brand. That way I can get the best result for my particular type of fabric and project.</P>

<p>Fabric paint is a dye-like paint that has binding agents added to increase its flexibility and durability. Depending on the desired opacity, it can be thicker or thinner than acrylic paint.</p>
<p>But there’s actually a lot more to it than that – below I’ll cover what makes fabric paint unique, whether or not you have to set fabric paint with heat, and if fabric paint and acrylic paint are the same. I’ll also cover the differences I noticed between testing all of these paints on a few different materials. Also, though I’ll be mentioning a lot of brands in this post, I’m not being sponsored to say anything and all opinions are my own.</p>
							
							<h3>WHAT MAKES FABRIC PAINT UNIQUE</h3>
							<p>Most fabric paint companies are surprisingly secretive about the ingredients of their paints – I called a ton of different manufacturers and none of them would share even the basic details of ingredients in their product</p>
							<ul>
                              <li>Fabric paint can be either thinner or thicker than acrylic paint, depending on the desired opacity</li>
							  <li>The rheology of the fabric paint can also differ based on it’s indended usage (think of rheology as a more in depth version of viscosity that works better for soft-solids)</li>
							  <li>There are essentially two types of fabric paint – those that stay on top of the fabric, and those that penetrate into the fibers. The fabric that stays on top gives an opaque finish, and those that penetrate into the fibers gives a more translucent finish</li>
							  <li>If you’re looking for a super soft finish, you’ll want to go with a penetrating, translucent option (like Jacquard’s Dye-Na-Flow Line)</li>
							  <li>If you’re looking for a super opaque finish, you’ll want to go with a fabric paint that sits on top of the fibers (Like Jacquard’s Neopaque Line)</li>
							 
							</ul>

						<h3>IS FABRIC PAINT THE SAME AS ACRYLIC?</h3>
						<p>Fabric Paint and Acrylic paint actually have a lot in common – it’s basically just the binding agents that make them different. Acrylic paints use a binder too, but it’s a more brittle version than fabric paints.

That makes a lot of sense, since many tutorials for painting fabric online use a regular acrylic paint and a textile medium (that acts as the binder). Of course, it likely won’t work as well as something formulated specifically to be used on fabric, but it opens up a huge array of colors – acrylic paint comes in basically every hue you can think of.</p>
<h3>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FABRIC PAINT, DYE, AND INK?</h3>
<p>There are a TON of products on the market designed to help you change the color of fabric. In short, dye soaks into the fabric, while paint tends to sit on top…but there’s more to the answer than that.Fabric Dye changes the color of your fabric without changing the texture by combining dye with mordants to help them adhere to the fabric. Nearly all dyes these days are synthetic, but you can definitely still purchase plant, animal, or mineral-based dyes.</p>

<p>Fabric Ink, on the other hand, changes the color of your fabric while only very slightly changing the texture (depending on the type of ink). Sometimes, fabric inks are alcohol-based, and other times they’re acrylic-based. I like to think of them as the spectrum between a true dye and a true paint.</p>

<p>Fabric Paint, which is usually acrylic paint mixed with a bonding agent, usually changes the texture of your fabric – though it really depends on the formulation and amount applied.</p>

<h3>FABRIC PAINTS AVAILABLE AT MICHAELS – IMPRESSIONS</h3>
<p>Because all the brands (besides Jacquard) were so secretive about what makes a fabric paint different from acrylic or latex paint, I decided to test things out for myself. I made a stop at Michaels to pick up everything but the Jacquard products, and to my local professional art supply store for the Jacquard products.</p>

<p>I noticed that anything with the word ‘ink’ in it seemed to soak through the fibers really well, but they also had a more translucent coloration. I can’t confirm (since most companies wouldn’t talk to me about specifics), but I would guess there is probably a higher amount of alcohol in the ink-like paints.</p>

<p>Anything with the word ‘dimensional’ or ‘3-D’ seemed to sit on top of the fibers and was MUCH thicker, which is great if you’re trying to cover up any texture. The two thickest were the Fabric Creations Plush 3-D Fabric Paint and the Tulip Puffy Dimensional Fabric Paint.</p>
<h3>JACQUARD FABRIC PAINT – IMPRESSIONS</h3>
<p>And then there were the Jacquard paints – sometimes making the extra effort to pick up a professional product is really worth it, and that’s exactly what happened in this case.

If I was going for an ink-like wash of color, I would absolutely use the Dye-Na-Flow. It acted exactly as ink would, and spread very easily.

                        				<h6><a href="404.php">A NOTE ABOUT NATURAL FIBERS AND SYNTHETICS</a></h6>
										<p>Not all fabric paints are well-suited for both natural fibers and synthetics. Nearly all-natural fibers (cotton, wool, silk, etc) are pretty easy to dye, but synthetics tend to be a lot harder. You’ve probably experienced this if you’ve ever tie-dyed a t-shirt, and while the cotton of the shirt changed colors, some of the synthetic thread in the stitching stayed white.</p>

<p>Because there are so many different kinds of fabric, you’ll want to test your paint of choice in a small, inconspicuous area before you start the whole project to make sure things adhere well.</p>
                        				<span class="btn-shape"></span>

                        				<h6><a href="404.php">TEXTURE DIFFERENCES</a></h6>
										<p>This is something I was definitely not expecting during my tests – just how different each of the textures of the finished fabric paints were. They ranged from not changing the fabric’s feel at all to feeling completely plastic-coated.</p>

<p>If you were to use these fabric paints on a non-cushy item, I think some of the more plastic-y paints could work well, but I could never imagine sitting comfortably on an item coated in that texture.

Overall, if you’re going to be using fabric paint on upholstery, I’d stay away from anything with the word ‘dimensional’, ‘3-D’, etc., and instead go for one of the more ink-like budget-friendly options, or a higher-end option like Jacquard’s products.</p>

						<center><h1 style="font-size:40px;"><b>Fabric Painting Techniques</b></h1></center>
						<p>Fabric painting simply refers to any painting done on a fabric. Today, people use fabric painting techniques to paint apparel such as t–shirts and jeans as well has home furnishings. However, these techniques have been around for thousands of years in Asia. It is believed that fabric painting originated around the the same time as weaving.</p>

<p>When Alexander the Great invaded India, many painted and printed fabrics were found. These fabrics made their way around trade routes as people traded these beautiful fabrics for other goods.

There is a rich history of fabric painting in Africa, Asia, and Europe as different cultures introduced new techniques to different areas.

There are many different techniques a person may use to paint fabric. Designs can be subtle or bold. Many art museums have samples of painted fabric throughout the centuries.

</p>
<h3>How to Paint Fabric: First Steps</h3>
<p>How do you paint fabric? Before painting fabric, a person needs to choose the fabric to be used. As will be discussed below, there are multiple different types of fabric that may be used.</p>

<p>Before beginning painting, a person would need to wash the fabric. Fabric weavers may use multiple different types of chemicals on the fabric, and these need to be washed away so that the paint will stick to the fabric. Washing the fabric also serves the purpose of removing the sizing, which is a coating added to every thread before weaving to improve weight, stiffness, and shine. It can be made of multiple different materials that make the fabric look more appealing.</p>

<p>Once the fabric is washed, it should be laid flat. It is not important to iron the fabric unless needed. When painting something like a t–shirt that has a front and a back, it is important to put cardboard or another material between the two pieces of fabric so the paint does not bleed from the front to the back or vice versa.</p>
<h3>What is Fabric Paint?</h3>
<p>There are multiple different choices when it comes to the paint to choose. Many craft and art stores sell fabric paint. What is fabric paint? This refers to paint and markers specifically made for use on fabrics. With these fabric paints, the artist does not have to worry about whether or not the paint will adhere to the fabric.</p>

<p>If an artist does not want to use fabric paint or if there is none available, he or she may choose to use acrylic paint with the aid of an extender medium. An extender medium is a clear substance that must be mixed with acrylic paint in order for the paint to adhere to the fabric.</p>
<h3>How to Use Fabric Paint</h3>
<p>How do you use fabric paint? There are multiple techniques and supplies an artist might employ when painting fabric. One of these supplies is a brush. There are many different types and sizes of brushes available. The type and size of brush used will depend on the artist’s purpose and the paints and fabrics used. These aren’t always necessary, however, if the artist chooses to use a fabric pen or marker.</p>

<p>There are multiple different types of fabrics that may be used, including cotton, silk or linen. Others may also be chosen depending upon the need. The fabric chosen will depend on the type of painting desired as well as the purpose for the final piece. Silk is used when choosing serti painting, while linen or cotton may be used for clothing or home decor.</p>
