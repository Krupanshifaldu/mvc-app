										Mehndi refers to the powdered leaf of a beautiful and fragrant flowering shrub known by many names - lawsonia inermis, henna, heena, hana, mignonette tree, and Egyptian privet, to list a few.

								        </p>
								        <p>The powdered leaf contains a compound called Lawsone, which when combined with a weak acid (diluted lemon juice or coffee) and a terping agent (eucalyptus or lavender oil), results in a paste that can be applied to colour skin, hair, nails, leather, silk, and wool. Though you may have heard of other colours such as black and white henna,  these are not true henna but concoctions of dye, synthetic pigment, and/or body adhesive applied in “henna” patterns. </p>

										Ranging from dark cherry to chocolate browns, getting a deep colour from your application is all about good aftercare, placement in an area where the dye absorbs well, and using fresh, high-quality paste. Light and dark skin stain equally well, creating shades darker than your own skin tone.

										Mehendi cones sold in markets may come with the presence of harmful chemicals like para-phenylenediamine (PPD) in the mixture, which could lead to strong skin reactions. In addition, the natural oils are being replaced with white oil to give a dark color. Some people are very sensitive to this chemical and the prolonged use of it can prove to be fatal. The chemical may cause itching, body ache, restlessness, etc. At Ram Kumar Mehandi Arts, you do not need to have to worry about the same at all.

We assure you that our Mehandi paste includes all the essentials and appropriate measures are taken to get the desired color effect so that you don’t have to put in any extra effort.

										Avoid the misconception that being dark-skinned prevents you from being able to have dark mehndi. This is certainly not the case. Although people with very dark skin may have to use only the best henna pastes, skin color has very little to do with the final hue of the dye.

										With the right fabric paint, your designs can stay beautiful and vibrant for a very long time. "From my experience, it lasts years if treated properly," says Cano-Murillo. She recommends setting your creations with heat. "Wait two days after painting, turn it inside out, and heat set with your iron to make it permanent, otherwise it could eventually fade," she recommends.

										Most fabric paint is made to be permanent, so it is not easily removable. "It is even more permanent because it bonds with the woven fibers of the fabric," Cano-Murillo shares. It can even stick to your skin if you're not careful!

For emergencies, there is a method to remove fabric paint after it has dried. It requires an alcohol-based liquid, warm water, and a lot of scrubbing with something coarse and rough. This could lessen the stain of the fabric paint, but acetones can deteriorate plastics, including acrylic, so they should never be used on acrylic fabric.

										Setting fabric paint with heat ensures that it will not wash off in the washing machine or dryer. Use a clean, dry, pressing cloth over your fabric paint design and iron it for two to five minutes. The settings of your iron will be determined by the fabric you are using. Do not use the steam setting of your iron or any water in the process.

										Yes, heat-setting is recommended to maximize the durability of your fabric decorated with Fantasy Glitter fabric paint. To heat-set your project, follow the instructions below:

<p>Allow the decorated fabric to dry overnight.</p>
<p>Heat an iron to the highest setting allowed for the decorated fabric.</p>
<p>Keeping the heated iron dry, position the project fabric decorated-side up and then lay a pressing cloth over the fabric.</p>
<p>Without using steam, press the decorated fabric area for 15 seconds, lift the iron and move to another section.</p>
<p>Continue until the entire design area has been heat-set.</p>
